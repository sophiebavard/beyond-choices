## Data availability
All raw data matrices are provided in .mat and .csv formats. 

>[!NOTE]
>Variable and column names are described below, please contact me if any question arises. The preregistration document is publically available on OSF: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/TZ4DQ

## Behavioral analyses   
Run the *behavioral_analyses_obsDG.m* script to produce *data_fig.mat*.   
The script loads the raw matrix *data_observeDG.mat* and extracts the variables of interest for the figures.

## Model fitting & model simulations
Participants' choices were modeled using likelihood maximization. Run the *model_fitting_RL.m* or *model_fitting_BO.m* scripts to produce *data_fitting_RL1.mat*, *data_fitting_RL2.mat* or *data_fitting_BO.mat*.     
The script loads the raw matrix *data_modelling.mat*, runs model fitting and simulations using the functions *function_fit_simu.m* and *wfpt.m*, and saves fitted variables in the dedicated files.

## Generate the figures   
Run the "*Figure...*" scripts to generate the figures.   
The scripts load the files *data_fig.mat*, *data_playDG16.mat*, *data_fitting_RL1.mat*, *data_fitting_RL2.mat* or *data_fitting_BO.mat*.

## Functions   
File *function_fit_simu.m* contains the algorithms used to fit and simulate the data for all models presented in the main text.   
File *wfpt.m* is the first passage time for Wiener diffusion model. Approximation based on Navarro & Fuss (2009).   
Files *SurfaceCurvePlot.m*, *SurfaceCurvePlot_model2.m*, *scatterCorrColorSpear.m*, *violinplotSB.m*  were created and used for visual purposes. Created by Sophie Bavard, 2023.
